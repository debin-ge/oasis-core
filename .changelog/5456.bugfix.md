go/p2p: Close connection to seed node after every request

Bootstrap client, which is responsible for peer discovery and advertisement,
now terminates connection to the seed node after every request. This action
should free up recourses (e.g. inbound/outbound connections) on both sides
without affecting performance since discovered peers are cached (see retention
period) and advertisement is done infrequently (see TTL).
