Bump Tendermint Core to 0.35.x

Configuration changes required due to Tendermint changes:

Flags `consensus.tendermint.p2p.max_num_{inbound,outbound}_peers` have
been replaced with a single `consensus.tendermint.p2p.max_connections`.
Flag `consensus.tendermint.state_sync.consensus_node` has been removed,
as it is no longer required.

Previously, when running a sentry node, the node behind the sentry had to
use `consensus.tendermint.p2p.disable_peer_exchange`, but now it must not
use that flag.  You must instead provide the sentry nodes' Tendermint IDs
using `consensus.tendermint.p2p.sentry_peers`, which automatically adds
the sentry peers to whitelisted peers and sets max connections and max
peers to total number of whitelisted peers.
