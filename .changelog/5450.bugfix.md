runtime: Create controller in RpcClient constructor

Previously if no RPC calls were initiated by the runtime, the client
controller task was never spawned which caused quote policy update
requests to pile up in the command queue, eventually blocking the entire
runtime from processing requests.

Since the async runtime is now available early on during initialization,
we can spawn the controller in the RpcClient constructor, avoiding these
problems.
