oasis-net-runner: Set default max_allowances, increase test account balance

The max_allowances staking setting in the default oasis-net-runner fixture has
been changed from 0 to 16 matching the testnet and mainnet setting. This
enables the allowance transactions locally which are required for doing
deposits to runtimes.

The initial balance of the default test account generated by the
oasis-net-runner was increased from 100 tokens to 1 million. This makes the
account directly suitable for deploying and running confidential smart
contracts (e.g. on the local Cipher instance) with more realistic transaction
fees.
