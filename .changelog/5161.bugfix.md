go/worker/compute: Do not drop valid proposals

Previously valid proposals could be dropped instead of being forwarded
via the P2P gossip when the local node's consensus view was slightly
behind even though the proposal was valid. With smaller committees and
certain topologies this could result in some nodes not getting the
proposals.
