config: add option to override internal unix socket path

Previously the UNIX socket path could only be overriden via a debug option
which also required the general "don't blame Oasis" to be set. Since this
option can be generally useful in production environments it is now supported
in the config file. The socket path can be set under
`common.internal_socket_path`, and is not considered a debug option anymore.
