runtime/src/protocol: Deserialize unknown rhp messages as invalid

Runtime-host protocol terminated the reader thread when failed to deserialize
a runtime message on the Rust side (e.g. when `Body` enum contained an unknown
field). Decoding is now more robust as these messages are deserialized as
invalid and latter discarded and logged as malformed by the handler.
