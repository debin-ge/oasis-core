go/runtime/host/multi: Propagate special requests to next version

Previously periodic consensus sync requests were not propagated to the
next (e.g. upcoming) runtime version. This could result in the runtime's
consensus view going stale which would make the attestations too old so
they would be rejected during scheduling.

Additionally, key manager update requests should also be propagated to
ensure the runtime is ready immediately when activated, avoiding any
potential race conditions.
